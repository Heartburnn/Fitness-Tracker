## PLEASE READ
Unfortunately I had some issues with Heroku, therefore to launch this program you have log into mysql to run the schema, run npm i, run npm start.
You will then see a site allowing you to create a workout or view a chart of your progress.

## KNOWN ISSUES 
No Heroku link, Can't start an exercise.
